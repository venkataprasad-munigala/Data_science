## Analysis of Breast Cancer

Breast cancer, a complex and prevalent disease, arises from the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in breast tissue. Regular screenings for early detection are vital for improving treatment outcomes. While it can affect both men and women, it is primarily diagnosed in women. Advances in medical research have led to better therapies, underscoring the importance of raising awareness, providing education, and offering support in the fight against breast cancer.

#### Incidence in Men (2021 Estimates)
The American Cancer Society projects that approximately 2,650 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in men in the U.S. in 2021.

#### Lifetime Risk for Women
According to the National Cancer Institute, the lifetime risk for women in the U.S. is around one in eight, meaning a woman has about a 12.5% chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime.
