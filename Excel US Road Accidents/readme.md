# Road Accidents Analysis using Excel

## Description:
The objective of this project is to analyze the data on road accidents in the UK and investigate how road infrastructure impacts the occurrence and seriousness of these accidents. The project seeks to offer valuable insights to various stakeholders, like the Ministry of Transport, the Road Transport Department, the Public, and the Media. These insights will assist in making well-informed decisions on how to improve road safety and minimize the likelihood and severity of road accidents in the UK.

## Insights:

<b>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):</b>
- The frequency and intensity of traffic collisions.
- Create visualizations for each of these key performance indicators to gain a deeper insight into their behaviors and developments.

<b>Monthly Trend of Accidents:</b>
- An analysis was conducted using a pivot table and line chart to showcase the monthly trend of accidents throughout the years.
- By utilizing this visualization, one can easily detect any repetitive patterns or fluctuations in accident incidents based on seasons.

<b>Impact of Road Type on Accidents:</b>
- A new pivot table was generated to examine the correlation between different road types and the frequency of accidents.
- The bar chart, illustrating the actual number of accidents for each road type, was presented.
- Data labels were incorporated into the chart to indicate the specific incidents for each road type, although there was some overcrowding
- In order to improve legibility, a customized number format was implemented.

<b>Influence of Road Conditions on Accidents:</b>
- An analysis was conducted using a pivot table to examine the impact of road conditions on accident occurrences.
- The road conditions data was divided into five categories: wet, flood, snow, frost, and dry.
- In order to streamline the data and make it more compact, calculated fields were generated to combine similar conditions like below
  wet + flood = wet, snow + frost = snow.
 
The treemap chart was utilized to visualize the insights, facilitating a concise comparison of accident frequencies across various road conditions. These valuable insights illuminate the influence of road infrastructure, road type, and road conditions on the magnitude and seriousness of road accidents in the United Kingdom. By providing stakeholders with informative visualizations, they are equipped with essential data to make well-informed choices and implement effective measures to enhance road safety and minimize the likelihood of accidents.
